"""
Local Persian ASR pipeline for the web backend.

Best deployable setup from the research/experiments, using the WhisperX-style
"transcribe and diarize independently, then assign speakers by overlap" design
so we get both good WER and good speaker labels:

  ffmpeg 16k mono
    ├─ Silero VAD -> ~24s chunks -> Whisper large-v3 (fa) [+ word times]
    └─ pyannote 3.1 speaker diarization (neural segmentation + WeSpeaker embeds)
  -> assign each word/segment the speaker whose turn it overlaps most
  -> Hazm Persian normalization

The actual Whisper inference is delegated to asr_engine.py, which picks
between MLX (Apple-Silicon GPU) and CTranslate2/faster-whisper (CUDA/CPU,
cross-platform) automatically -- see that module for details.

pyannote 3.1 is gated: it needs a Hugging Face token (cached via
`huggingface_hub login`) with the model's user conditions accepted. If it is
unavailable, the pipeline degrades to a lightweight resemblyzer clustering and,
failing that, a single speaker -- transcription still works either way.

An optional `correct_fn(text, speaker, context) -> text` hook (see correct.py)
can be supplied to lightly clean up each segment's text right after it is
produced, before it is streamed to the client or included in the final result.
